# Jev completion and skill experiments

This package maintains three named, frozen evaluation scenarios. Preparing a scenario creates a **new** batch; it never resumes or edits an earlier run. The plugin under evaluation is supplied as a tarball. The package does not change Jev or DSH product code.

| Scenario ID | Trials | Main model | Variable |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `initial-26` | 26 | Scripted for six completion pairs; DeepSeek Flash for six skill pairs and one coding pair | Completion check or skill selection, one feature per pair |
| `coding-followup-4` | 4 | DeepSeek Flash | Completion check, two AB/BA pairs on the original Vitest task |
| `skill-repository-8` | 8 | DeepSeek Flash | Skill selection, two fixed 24-skill repository tasks with two AB/BA pairs each |

The checked-in [resource example](resources.example.json) lists every external input. Copy it outside the repository, replace the relative `paths` with your own resource locations, and keep the version, task, model route, endpoint, and credential reference fields accurate. Relative paths resolve from the resource JSON file. DeepSWE and Pier must be checked out at the declared commits; the Node archive and plugin tarball must match their SHA-256 values. The Docker image is pinned by digest. The optional `dsh_install` directory contains `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `identity.json` for the declared DSH version; without it, preparation creates a new npm lock in the new batch. Neither path depends on a historical batch.

The scenario fixes the task, DSH version, main/Jev routes, feature flags, tools, ordering, timeouts, and stop rules. A resource file may declare a different `versions.plugin_commit`, matching `versions.plugin_tar_sha256`, or price snapshot; these become a visibly different batch identity. The existing DeepSWE validator checks the actual tarball bytes, Node archive, source commits, and price fields. The batch records its scenario ID, Git HEAD, dirty state, exact maintained-source hashes, resource file hash, artifact hash, image, manifests, jobs, and input locks. A Git HEAD alone does not identify uncommitted evaluation code. A floating `deepseek-flash` alias, live service state, and credentials can change between runs, so a new batch is not a promise of identical output.

From the repository root, with Python `uv`, Node/pnpm, Docker, the checked-out resources, and Pier dependencies available:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" uv run --project /path/to/pier python -m bench.completion_skill.cli list
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" uv run --project /path/to/pier python -m bench.completion_skill.cli prepare initial-26 --resources /path/to/resources.json --batch /path/to/new-batch
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" uv run --project /path/to/pier python -m bench.completion_skill.cli check --batch /path/to/new-batch
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" uv run --project /path/to/pier python -m bench.completion_skill.cli preflight --batch /path/to/new-batch
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" uv run --project /path/to/pier python -m bench.completion_skill.cli report --batch /path/to/new-batch
```

Replace `initial-26` with `coding-followup-4` or `skill-repository-8` to prepare either follow-up. `check` validates frozen source, resource-derived manifests, profiles, tasks, runtime locks, and Pier jobs. `preflight` runs keyless published-DSH native probes for completion and skill plumbing where a scripted main and loopback Jev can exercise it; the coding follow-up retains the real task and verifier but has no keyless substitute for a real coding model. Probe output is separate from paid trial output and never establishes real-provider accuracy.

For formal execution, configure the declared `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` and `JEV_API_KEY` references in DSH local credentials, or provide Jev through a protected non-TTY pipe with `--jev-key-stdin`. The launcher reads the references without saving values and supplies them only to the serial runner. `initial-26` completion trials use a local scripted main and need only Jev when invoking `next`; its skill and coding trials, and both follow-ups, require both providers. Run one slot at a time and inspect the report before continuing:

```sh
node bench/completion_skill/credential_launcher.mjs next --batch /path/to/new-batch --execute
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" uv run --project /path/to/pier python -m bench.completion_skill.cli report --batch /path/to/new-batch
```

`run` in place of `next` advances serially until every slot is complete or a stop condition occurs. A running or halted slot, incomplete evidence, unknown usage cost, or advisory spending threshold stops further calls. There is no automatic retry or implicit reset. To repeat an experiment, choose its scenario ID and a new batch path. Historical outcomes are documented separately in the repository's testing report; they were produced by the original frozen drivers, not by a paid rerun of this maintained entry.

Focused keyless tests:

```sh
PYTHONPATH="$PWD" uv run --project /path/to/pier python -m unittest bench.completion_skill.tests.test_portable -v
```
